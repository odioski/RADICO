PREAMBLE:

Several years ago I tried to inform a few about ASCII art and what I knew about it and some simple techniques to explain how one is created. An ASCII art is the graphic which sometimes is part of the README that may come with some dev:admin cli tools. They're kind of cool since if you look close, the image is composed of characters found on most keyboards. Like cross-hatching while sketching with ink some depth and shading can be visualized with the very detailed graphincs of this kind. Such is the atraction that comes across for most who enjoy such pictorials.

I couldn’t recall the official term but had referenced back to when I was even younger during the elementary school years when I had first came across it. That happened either in 1984 or 1985 while in computer classes when I learned a few fundamentals about software and what it is to the machine using it.

Bare in mind, the README, INSTALL or any other MARKUP can't possibly allude to one thing or another other than the contents of the file, or the contents those individual files host. As I mentioned, host or clients, guests, temporary visitors or new owners, they're all objects. The files, the devices, the whole shabiz from the software’s perspective as well as the machine.

Admittedly such experiences were found on the darker sides of code and the internet, but we learned to craft such graphics as children, long ago, when the world had a bit of trouble running about. For us it wasn't that serious just a recreational activity or treat after classwork was either completed or suspended.

After creating this, ASCII ART.INFO.md for a personal project, I found via Copiilot an acurate description of the art form and it (AI) also provided some instructions on how to craft your own.

The following was then compiled into what’s linked below, a short tutorial on building ASCII Art using RADICA a banner for my latest app, the first of one my repos RADICO, as an example. I’ll mention that the extended Unicode character set was something which was built way back in the 80’s when I first heard of it, possible even further in the past since modern computing back then was fairly formed and close to a solid model of what Personal Computing would become for the next few decades by as early as the late 70s. I had forgotten about the term used to describe the artform until now, but I do remember the extended/subset of Unicode being mentioned.

Originally the idea behind the extended Unicode subset was readability or making the image stand out in a way which is legible for most. Very easy for one to link ASCII art to the very early origins of pixel art but back then during that era, most computer generated images crafted by hand had that..., :the Pixel Art kind of look: so it wasn’t definition then.

Throughout the years I’ve come across many ASCII arts. Many who code in bash, or write shell scripts and those who code in general have a yearning creative side and it isn’t unusual to find one of these drawings as part of a README, NFO usually, or what have you. This document will help those who might be true beginners or inform beginners, as well as those who are advanced, or those who may be curious about tools which can simplify the process.

Additionally, the older craft of cross-hatching with pen or ink can reproduce similar effects like the layers I’ve already mentioned or a sense of depth and often shadow. ASCII art uses alphabetic characters, symbols, and numeric characters found on your keyboard to create the same. Adjusting the size of the font before a character is used and exercising some judgement (artist's discretion) on which characters you choose gives even more fine/precise control. With enough skill or technique a sense of depth or shadow can be applied to the drawing depending on the artist's intentions, very much like cross-hatching with simple pen and paper is accomplished.

Have fun!

## 🧩 Understanding ASCII Art

**ASCII Art** is the practice of creating images and designs using printable ASCII characters. The RADICA banner above uses **Unicode Box Drawing Characters** - a special subset of Unicode that provides various line and block characters perfect for creating structured text art.

### 🎯 Why Box Drawing Characters?

Box drawing characters are ideal for creating bold, readable text because they:
- ✅ **Form solid blocks** that create clear letter shapes
- ✅ **Maintain consistency** across different terminals and fonts
- ✅ **Scale uniformly** regardless of font size
- ✅ **Render reliably** on virtually all modern systems

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Creation Process

### 📐 Step 1: Plan Your Layout

1. **Determine letter height**: RADICA uses 6 rows (including foundation)
2. **Calculate spacing**: Each letter needs consistent width
3. **Map character placement**: Sketch rough outline first

### ✏️ Step 2: Start with Basic Blocks

Begin with the simplest approach - using only full blocks (`█`):

```
██████  █████  ██████  ██ ██████  █████ 
██  ██ ██   ██ ██   ██ ██ ██     ██   ██
██████ ███████ ██   ██ ██ ██     ███████
██  ██ ██   ██ ██   ██ ██ ██     ██   ██
██  ██ ██   ██ ██████  ██ ██████ ██   ██
██  ██ ██   ██ ██████  ██ ██████ ██   ██
```

### 🎭 Step 3: Add Box Drawing Details

Replace solid blocks with box drawing characters for refinement:

```
██████╗  █████╗ ██████╗ ██╗ ██████╗ █████╗ 
██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██║██╔════╝██╔══██╗

## 🏆 Pro Tips for ASCII Art Masters

### 🎯 Essential Shortcuts

1. **Font Testing**: Always test in `Courier New`, `Consolas`, and default terminal fonts
2. **Spacing Tool**: Use periods (`.`) as placeholders while designing: `.█.█.`
3. **Copy-Paste**: Build a character palette for quick access
4. **Version Control**: Save iterations as you refine designs

### 🛡️ Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem**: Characters don't align properly
- **Solution**: Ensure monospace font is selected
- **Test**: Use ruler: `1234567890` on line above art

**Problem**: Unicode characters show as boxes
- **Solution**: Verify terminal Unicode support
- **Fallback**: Use basic ASCII characters: `+|-#*`

**Problem**: Art looks different in various terminals  
- **Solution**: Test in multiple environments
- **Standard**: Stick to widely-supported characters

### 🎨 Style Inspiration

**Retro Computing**: Use `▓▒░` and simple lines
**Modern Clean**: Focus on `║═╔╗╚╝` characters  
**Decorative**: Incorporate `◆◇●○` elements
**Technical**: Use grid patterns with `┼├┤┬┴`
