PREAMBLE:

Several years ago I tried to inform a few about ASCII art and what I knew about it and some simple techniques to explain how one is created. An ASCII art is the graphic which sometimes is part of the README which comes with some dev:admin cli tools. They're kind of cool since if you look close the image is composed of charachters found on most keyboards. Like cross-hatching while sketching with ink some depth and shading can be visualized with the very detailed graphincs of this kind. Such is the atraction that comes across for most who enjoy such pictorials.

I couldn’t recall the official term but had referenced back to when I was even younger during the elementary school years when I had first came across it. That happened either in 1984 or 1985 while in computer classes when I learned a few fundamentals about software and what it is to the machine using it.

Bare in mind, the README, INSTALL or any other MARKUP can't possibly allude to one thing or another other than the title of the files it contains, or hosts. Admittedly such experiences were found on the darker sides of code and the internet, but we learned to craft such graphics as children, long ago, when the world had a bit of trouble running about. For us it wasn't that serious though, just a recreational activity or treat after classwork was either completed or suspended.

After creating this, ASCII ART.INFO.md for a personal project, the repository you may currently be perusing... I found via Copiilot an acurate description of the *art form* and it also provided some instructions on how to craft your own.

The following was then compiled into what you see below, a short tutorial on building ASCII Art using RADICA a banner for my latest app, the first of this repo RADICO, as an example. I’ll mention that the extended Unicode character set was something which was built way back in the 80’s when I first heard of it, possible even further in the past since modern computing back then was fairly formed and close to a solid model of what Personal Computing would become for the next few decades by as early as the late 70s. I had forgotten about the term used to describe the artform until now, but I do remember the extended/subset of Unicode being mentitoned. 

Originally the idea behind the extended Unicode subset was readability or making the image stand out in a way which is legible for most. Very easy for one to link ASCII art to the very early origins of pixel art but back then during that era, most computer generated images crafted by hand had that..., :the Pixel Art kind of look: so it wasn’t definition then.

Throughout the years I’ve come across many ASCII arts. Many who code in bash, or write shell scripts and those who code in general have a yearning creative side and it isn’t unusual to find one of these drawings in an README, NFO usually, or what have you. This document will help those who might be true beginners or inform beginners, as well as those who are advanced, or those who may be curious about tools which can simplify the process.

Remember that using extended Unicode isn’t the only way, your imagination is your only limitation. There are many ASCII arts out there which use characters that can be found on all standard 101 keyboards, QUERTY keyboards, and for perhapss less comprehended languages, keyboareds, constructs (layouts) offer their own selections. You’d be amazed by how technical, detailed, very often layered, and visually appealing some of those graphics are. The subset of Unicode detailed here explains the use of the block characters used to create the examples.

## 🧩 Understanding ASCII Art

**ASCII Art** is the practice of creating images and designs using printable ASCII characters. The RADICA banner above uses **Unicode Box Drawing Characters** - a special subset of Unicode that provides various line and block characters perfect for creating structured text art.

### 🎯 Why Box Drawing Characters?

Box drawing characters are ideal for creating bold, readable text because they:
- ✅ **Form solid blocks** that create clear letter shapes
- ✅ **Maintain consistency** across different terminals and fonts
- ✅ **Scale uniformly** regardless of font size
- ✅ **Render reliably** on virtually all modern systems

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Creation Process

### 📐 Step 1: Plan Your Layout

1. **Determine letter height**: RADICA uses 6 rows (including foundation)
2. **Calculate spacing**: Each letter needs consistent width
3. **Map character placement**: Sketch rough outline first

### ✏️ Step 2: Start with Basic Blocks

Begin with the simplest approach - using only full blocks (`█`):

```
██████  █████  ██████  ██ ██████  █████ 
██  ██ ██   ██ ██   ██ ██ ██     ██   ██
██████ ███████ ██   ██ ██ ██     ███████
██  ██ ██   ██ ██   ██ ██ ██     ██   ██
██  ██ ██   ██ ██████  ██ ██████ ██   ██
██  ██ ██   ██ ██████  ██ ██████ ██   ██
```

### 🎭 Step 3: Add Box Drawing Details

Replace solid blocks with box drawing characters for refinement:

```
██████╗  █████╗ ██████╗ ██╗ ██████╗ █████╗ 
██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██║██╔════╝██╔══██╗
██████╔╝███████║██║  ██║██║██║     ███████║

## 🎨 Design Principles for ASCII Banners

### ✨ Aesthetic Guidelines

1. **Consistency is Key**
   - Use the same character set throughout
   - Maintain uniform letter spacing
   - Keep line heights consistent

2. **Readability First**
   - Ensure letters are distinguishable
   - Test in different terminal fonts
   - Verify contrast in various color schemes

3. **Terminal Compatibility**
   - Test in multiple terminal emulators
   - Verify Unicode support across systems
   - Consider fallback options for limited environments

### 🎯 Advanced Techniques

#### **3D Effects**
Add depth using different block characters:
```
████╗ ██╗     instead of     ██║ ██║
██╔╝ ██║                      ██║ ██║
```

#### **Gradient Effects**
Use partial block characters for shading:
```
████▓▓▒▒░░  (Full to light gradient)
```

#### **Shadow Effects**
Offset copies with different characters:
```
██████╗     ▓▓▓▓▓▓▒
██╔══██╗    ▓▓▒▒▓▓▒▒
```

## 🏆 Pro Tips for ASCII Art Masters

### 🎯 Essential Shortcuts

1. **Font Testing**: Always test in `Courier New`, `Consolas`, and default terminal fonts
2. **Spacing Tool**: Use periods (`.`) as placeholders while designing: `.█.█.`
3. **Copy-Paste**: Build a character palette for quick access
4. **Version Control**: Save iterations as you refine designs

### 🛡️ Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem**: Characters don't align properly
- **Solution**: Ensure monospace font is selected
- **Test**: Use ruler: `1234567890` on line above art

**Problem**: Unicode characters show as boxes
- **Solution**: Verify terminal Unicode support
- **Fallback**: Use basic ASCII characters: `+|-#*`

**Problem**: Art looks different in various terminals  
- **Solution**: Test in multiple environments
- **Standard**: Stick to widely-supported characters

### 🎨 Style Inspiration

**Retro Computing**: Use `▓▒░` and simple lines
**Modern Clean**: Focus on `║═╔╗╚╝` characters  
**Decorative**: Incorporate `◆◇●○` elements
**Technical**: Use grid patterns with `┼├┤┬┴`

## 🌟 The RADICA Banner: A Masterpiece Analysis

### 🎭 Artistic Choices Explained

**Font Weight**: Bold, block-style letters ensure readability in any terminal environment

**Character Selection**: Double-line box drawing (`╔╗╚╝║═`) creates a sophisticated, professional appearance

**Spacing**: Consistent single-space separation maintains balance without crowding

**Foundation**: The bottom line (`╚═╝  ╚═╝`) provides visual grounding and completion

**Subtitle Integration**: The tagline uses regular text to contrast with the elaborate ASCII art

### 🏗️ Construction Secrets

1. **Modular Design**: Each letter is self-contained but harmonizes with others
2. **Corner Logic**: Strategic use of corner pieces creates clean letter boundaries  
3. **Internal Structure**: Hollow letters reduce visual weight while maintaining impact
4. **Vertical Alignment**: All letters share the same baseline and cap height
